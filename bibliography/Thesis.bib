@book{Asche2011,
abstract = {First published in 1990, The Economics of Salmon Aquaculture was the first book to systematically analyse the salmon aquaculture industry, from both a market and production perspective. Since publication of the first edition of this book, the salmon aquaculture industry has grown at a phenomenal rate, with salmon now being consumed in more than 100 countries worldwide. This second edition of a very popular and successful book brings the reader right up to date with all the major current issues pertaining to salmon aquaculture. Commencing with an overview of the production process in aquaculture, the following chapters provide in-depth coverage of the sources of the world's supply of salmon, the growth in productivity, technological changes, environmental issues, markets, market structure and competitiveness, lessons that can be learnt from the culture of other species, optimal harvesting techniques, production planning, and investment in salmon farms. Written by Frank Ashe and Trond Bj\o rndal, two of the world's leading experts in the economics of aquaculture, this second edition of The Economics of Salmon Aquaculture provides the salmon aquaculture industry with an essential reference work, including a wealth of commercially important information. This book is also a valuable resource for upper level students and professionals in aquaculture and economics, and libraries in all universities and research establishments where these subjects are studied and taught should have copies of this important book on their shelves.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to recognize various deformable objects from
images. To this end we extend the class of generative probabilistic
models known as pictorial structures. This class of models is
particularly suited to represent articulated structures, and has
previously been used by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher for pose
estimation of humans.  We extend pictorial structures in three ways:
(i) likelihoods are included for both the boundary and the enclosed
texture of the animal; (ii) a complete graph is modelled (rather than
a tree structure); (iii) it is demonstrated that the model can be
fitted in polynomial time using belief propagation.

We show examples for two types of quadrupeds, cows and horses.  We
achieve excellent recognition performance for cows with an equal error
rate of 3\% for 500 positive and 5000 negative images.},

abstract = {Monitoring the growth of farmed fish is an important task which is currently difficult to carry out. An underwater stereo image analysis technique offers the potential for estimating key dimensions of free-swimming fish, from which the fish mass can be estimated. This paper describes the development of a three-dimensional point distribution model to capture the typical shape and variability of salmon viewed from the side. The model was fitted to stereo images of test fish by minimizing an energy function, which was based on probability distributions. The minimization was an iterated two-step method in which edges were selected for magnitude, direction, and proximity to the model, and the model was then fitted to the edges. A search strategy for locating the edges in \{3D\} was devised. The model is tested on two image sets. In the first set 19 of the 26 fish are located in spite of their variable appearance and the presence of neighboring fish. In the second set the measurements made on 11 images of fish are compared with manual measurements of the fish dimensions and show an average error in length estimation of 5\%.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

The three sectors provide different social, economic and cultural benefits to society, but also face many problems and challenges. They have different interests, practices, traditions and audiences, and are also administered by different authorities and regulated under varying management regimes and legislations. On the one hand, they complement each other in terms of product supply, employment creation and income; on the other hand, they face conflicts over management objectives and strategies. This paper provides an overview of the salmon sectors associated with their status, challenges and management regimes.

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function.},

abstract = {We present a method for real-time 3D object instance detection that does not require a time-consuming training stage, and can handle untextured objects. At its core, our approach is a novel image representation for template matching designed to be robust to small image transformations. This robustness is based on spread image gradient orientations and allows us to test only a small subset of all possible pixel locations when parsing the image, and to represent a 3D object with a limited set of templates. In addition, we demonstrate that if a dense depth sensor is available we can extend our approach for an even better performance also taking 3D surface normal orientations into account. We show how to take advantage of the architecture of modern computers to build an efficient but very discriminant representation of the input images that can be used to consider thousands of templates in real time. We demonstrate in many experiments on real data that our method is much faster and more robust with respect to background clutter than current state-of-the-art methods.},

Our model can detect objects whose boundaries are not necessarily defined by the gradient. We minimize an energy which can be seen as a particular case of the minimal partition problem. In the level set formulation, the problem becomes a "mean-curvature flow"-like evolving the active contour, which will stop on the desired boundary. However, the stopping term does not depend on the gradient of the image, as in the classical active contour models, but is instead related to a particular segmentation of the image. We give a numerical algorithm using finite differences. Finally, we present various experimental results and in particular some examples for which the classical snakes methods based on the gradient are not applicable. Also, the initial curve can be anywhere in the image, and interior contours are automatically detected.},

abstract = {Partial computation elimination techniques are often used for fast template matching. At a particular search location, computations are prematurely terminated as soon as it is found that this location cannot compete already known best-match location. Due to non-monotonic growth pattern of the correlationbased similarity measures, partial computation elimination techniques have been traditionally considered inapplicable to speedup these measures. In this work we show that partial elimination techniques may be applied to correlation coefficient by using a monotonic formulation and we propose a basic mode and an extended mode partial correlation elimination[1] A. Mahmood and S. Khan, “Correlation-coefficient-based fast template matching through partial Elimination,” IEEE Trans. Image Process., vol. 21, no. 4, pp. 2099–2108, 2012. algorithm for fast template matching. The basic mode algorithm is more efficient on small template sizes while the extended mode is faster on medium and larger templates. We also propose a strategy to decide which algorithm to use for a given dataset. To achieve a high speed up, elimination algorithms require an initial guess of the peak correlation value. We propose two initialization schemes including coarse-to-fine scheme for larger templates and a two-stage technique for small and medium sized templates. Our proposed algorithms are exact, having exhaustive equivalent accuracy, and are compared with the existing fast techniques using real image datasets on a wide variety of template sizes. While the actual speedups are data dependent, in most of the cases our proposed algorithms have been found to be significantly faster than the other algorithms.},

@inproceedings{Dalal2005,
abstract = {We study the question of feature sets for robust visual object recognition; adopting linear SVM based human detection as a test case. After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds.},

@article{Viola2001,
abstract = { This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "integral image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.},
