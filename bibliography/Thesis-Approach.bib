@article{Felzenszwalb2005,
abstract = {The goal of this paper is to recognize various deformable objects from
images. To this end we extend the class of generative probabilistic
models known as pictorial structures. This class of models is
particularly suited to represent articulated structures, and has
previously been used by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher for pose
estimation of humans.  We extend pictorial structures in three ways:
(i) likelihoods are included for both the boundary and the enclosed
texture of the animal; (ii) a complete graph is modelled (rather than
a tree structure); (iii) it is demonstrated that the model can be
fitted in polynomial time using belief propagation.

We show examples for two types of quadrupeds, cows and horses.  We
achieve excellent recognition performance for cows with an equal error
rate of 3\% for 500 positive and 5000 negative images.},

@article{Lowe2004,
abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

abstract = {We describe an object detection system based on mixtures of multiscale deformable part models. Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function.},

@article{Hinterstoisser2012,
abstract = {We present a method for real-time 3D object instance detection that does not require a time-consuming training stage, and can handle untextured objects. At its core, our approach is a novel image representation for template matching designed to be robust to small image transformations. This robustness is based on spread image gradient orientations and allows us to test only a small subset of all possible pixel locations when parsing the image, and to represent a 3D object with a limited set of templates. In addition, we demonstrate that if a dense depth sensor is available we can extend our approach for an even better performance also taking 3D surface normal orientations into account. We show how to take advantage of the architecture of modern computers to build an efficient but very discriminant representation of the input images that can be used to consider thousands of templates in real time. We demonstrate in many experiments on real data that our method is much faster and more robust with respect to background clutter than current state-of-the-art methods.},

@article{Chan2001,
abstract = {We propose a new model for active contours to detect objects in a given image, based on techniques of curve evolution, Mumford-Shah (1989) functional for segmentation and level sets. Our model can detect objects whose boundaries are not necessarily defined by the gradient. We minimize an energy which can be seen as a particular case of the minimal partition problem. In the level set formulation, the problem becomes a "mean-curvature flow"-like evolving the active contour, which will stop on the desired boundary. However, the stopping term does not depend on the gradient of the image, as in the classical active contour models, but is instead related to a particular segmentation of the image. We give a numerical algorithm using finite differences. Finally, we present various experimental results and in particular some examples for which the classical snakes methods based on the gradient are not applicable. Also, the initial curve can be anywhere in the image, and interior contours are automatically detected.},

@article{Mahmood2012,
abstract = {Partial computation elimination techniques are often used for fast template matching. At a particular search location, computations are prematurely terminated as soon as it is found that this location cannot compete already known best-match location. Due to non-monotonic growth pattern of the correlationbased similarity measures, partial computation elimination techniques have been traditionally considered inapplicable to speedup these measures. In this work we show that partial elimination techniques may be applied to correlation coefficient by using a monotonic formulation and we propose a basic mode and an extended mode partial correlation elimination[1] A. Mahmood and S. Khan, “Correlation-coefficient-based fast template matching through partial Elimination,” IEEE Trans. Image Process., vol. 21, no. 4, pp. 2099–2108, 2012. algorithm for fast template matching. The basic mode algorithm is more efficient on small template sizes while the extended mode is faster on medium and larger templates. We also propose a strategy to decide which algorithm to use for a given dataset. To achieve a high speed up, elimination algorithms require an initial guess of the peak correlation value. We propose two initialization schemes including coarse-to-fine scheme for larger templates and a two-stage technique for small and medium sized templates. Our proposed algorithms are exact, having exhaustive equivalent accuracy, and are compared with the existing fast techniques using real image datasets on a wide variety of template sizes. While the actual speedups are data dependent, in most of the cases our proposed algorithms have been found to be significantly faster than the other algorithms.},

abstract = {We study the question of feature sets for robust visual object recognition; adopting linear SVM based human detection as a test case. After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds.},

@article{Viola2001,
abstract = { This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "integral image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.},
