@book{Asche2011,
abstract = {First published in 1990, The Economics of Salmon Aquaculture was the first book to systematically analyse the salmon aquaculture industry, from both a market and production perspective. Since publication of the first edition of this book, the salmon aquaculture industry has grown at a phenomenal rate, with salmon now being consumed in more than 100 countries worldwide. This second edition of a very popular and successful book brings the reader right up to date with all the major current issues pertaining to salmon aquaculture. Commencing with an overview of the production process in aquaculture, the following chapters provide in-depth coverage of the sources of the world's supply of salmon, the growth in productivity, technological changes, environmental issues, markets, market structure and competitiveness, lessons that can be learnt from the culture of other species, optimal harvesting techniques, production planning, and investment in salmon farms. Written by Frank Ashe and Trond Bj\o rndal, two of the world's leading experts in the economics of aquaculture, this second edition of The Economics of Salmon Aquaculture provides the salmon aquaculture industry with an essential reference work, including a wealth of commercially important information. This book is also a valuable resource for upper level students and professionals in aquaculture and economics, and libraries in all universities and research establishments where these subjects are studied and taught should have copies of this important book on their shelves.},

abstract = {Sales and distribution innovations have increased productivity in the$\backslash$nsalmon aquaculture industry. In this article, we investigate the use of$\backslash$nfixed price contracts for Norwegian salmon exports to France based on$\backslash$nall export transactions between the two countries. Our analysis shows$\backslash$nthat almost 25\% of these exports were traded using fixed price$\backslash$ncontracts and contract prices were renegotiated at different intervals,$\backslash$nincluding as infrequently as once a year. Some contracts allow the$\backslash$ncontracting parties to adjust contract prices when the export price$\backslash$nmoves significantly. Benchmark analysis, which shows a marginal 0.5\%$\backslash$ndifference between average unit revenue for the year from spot sales$\backslash$nrelative to contract sales, indicates that contracts primarily change$\backslash$nrevenue time profiles. The use of contracts creates a wedge between$\backslash$nsalmon export prices and spot prices in periods of price volatility$\backslash$nwhich in turn reduces price transmission.},

@article{Liu2011,
abstract = {The Salmon industry in Norway includes three sectors, namely sea and river fishing for wild salmon, and salmon farming, or aquaculture. The three sectors provide different social, economic and cultural benefits to society, but also face many problems and challenges. They have different interests, practices, traditions and audiences, and are also administered by different authorities and regulated under varying management regimes and legislations. On the one hand, they complement each other in terms of product supply, employment creation and income; on the other hand, they face conflicts over management objectives and strategies. This paper provides an overview of the salmon sectors associated with their status, challenges and management regimes. It further analyzes their interests and conflicts over economic contribution and management. Finally, some potential solutions are suggested in an attempt to solve these conflicts. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},
